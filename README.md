# Iris_Flowers_Classification
## Abstract:
The Iris Flowers Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies different species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the famous "Iris" dataset, which contains samples of three iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## 1. Introduction:
Iris flowers are widely known for their distinct species, and the classification of these species is crucial for botanical research and gardening. In this project, we aim to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers based on their physical attributes, namely the length and width of sepals and petals.
